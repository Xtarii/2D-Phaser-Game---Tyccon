### Project Structure
Project consists of a monorepo, that is "more than one package in the same project".
This is not needed but good to learn because companies like Google, Facebook and more
use monorepos.

Therefore this project consists of:
- Utils : A Package for Application Functions like ```sleep(<ms>)``` and Configuration Managing.
- Components : Taken from Unity, I made a package for game components like ```UI``` or ```entities```

To start all of these components I use [Turborepo](https://turbo.build).
```bash
npm start # Runs Turbo

npm run build-dev # Runs Turbo pre-build for some packages.
```
